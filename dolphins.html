        <h1>Dolphins!</h1>
        <p>Here is some information about dolphins...</p>
        <p>
        1. Dolphins are predators that eat an average of 15 kilograms of fish per day. Their diet is very diverse, but shrimp and squid are their favorite foods. Since dolphins eat a lot, their digestion is very fast.
        2. They are one of the few marine species whose hunting style is similar to a wolf pack, where they work together and each plays a specific role. This makes them very good hunters.
        3. Dolphins have almost no natural predators, and humans are the main predators of dolphins. Especially in groups, dolphins can fight sharks and protect their young.
        4. Some archaeologists actually believe that millions of years ago, dolphins originally had legs and were land animals. In modern times, they have even been seen with additional fins, which indirectly supports this idea.
        5. Although the various variations of dolphins are about 40 million years old, the first record of a dolphin-human interaction was found in the ancient city of Petra in Jordan. In ancient Greece, dolphins were also important and were often used by the gods as messengers, and they were highly respected. The Romans believed that dolphins carried souls to an island. It was considered a great sin to kill a dolphin in any culture.
